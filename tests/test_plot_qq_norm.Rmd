```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Purpose

The plot test series is used to test the function **plot_norm_qq.R**.

## Load required packages and functions

```{r}
library( tidyverse )                    # I live in the tidy verse ...
library( cowplot )                      # Useful extensions to ggplot ...

source('D:/R-Projects/Rsource/plot_qq_norm.R')

set.seed( 1127 )

```


## Test function plot_norm_qq.R

### Case 1: Normal distribution small sample

```{r}
y <- rnorm( 16, mean = 70, sd =6 )
y

plot_qq_norm( variable = y, 
              variable_name = "Variable y",
              plot_title = "Small sample test")
```

### Case 2: Normal distribution with larger number of bootstrap simulations

```{r}
plot_qq_norm( variable = y, 
              R = 100,
              variable_name = "Variable y",
              plot_title = "Small sample test")
```

### Case 3: Larger sample size 

```{r}
y <- rnorm( 100, mean = 80, sd = 6 )
y

plot_qq_norm( variable = y, 
              R = 100,
              variable_name = "Variable y",
              plot_title = "Large sample normal distribution")
y
```

### Case 4: Small sample test with upper tuncation of the normal at 100

```{r}
score <- rnorm( 25, mean = 75, sd = 10 )
score <- round( score )
score


plot_qq_norm( variable = score, 
              R = 100,
              variable_name = "Exam score",
              plot_title = "Small sample with truncated upper tail")

```

## Case 6: Laege sample with truncated upper distribution

```{r}
score <- rnorm( 100, mean = 80, sd = 15 )
score <- ifelse( score > 100, 100, score)

score <- round( score )

plot_qq_norm( variable = score, 
              R = 100,
              variable_name = "Exam Score",
              plot_title = "Large sample normal distribution truncated at 100")


```

## 7: Sall sample Students t distribution with 1 degree of freedom

```{r}
t <- rt( 25, df = 1 )
t


```

```{r}
plot_qq_norm( variable = t, 
              R = 50,
              variable_name = "Exame Score",
              plot_title = "Student's t distribution with 1 degree of freedom")
```

## Lognormal distribution simulated distribution

```{r}
mu <- log( 55000 )
sd <- 3.5

income <- exp( rnorm( 100, mean = mu, sd = sd ))
income <- round( income )
income

plot_qq_norm( variable = income, 
              R = 50,
              variable_name = "Family income",
              plot_title = "Log normal distribution simulating family income")
```
